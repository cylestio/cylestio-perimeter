# 🔒 Security Policy

## Overview

Cylestio Gateway is designed with security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and security guarantees for enterprise customers.

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

Our security pipeline runs comprehensive scans on every commit and pull request:

- **🔍 Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**: Using `pip-audit` and `safety` to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **🔐 Secret Detection**: Using `detect-secrets` and `gitleaks` to prevent credential leakage
- **🔎 Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Using `Semgrep` and `Bandit` for code security analysis
- **🐳 Container Security**: Using `Trivy` to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
- **📄 License Compliance**: Automated license scanning to ensure compliance with enterprise policies

### Pre-Commit Security Hooks

Developers are protected by pre-commit hooks that run locally:
- Secret detection before code is committed
- Security linting with Bandit
- Code quality checks with Ruff and Black
- Type safety with MyPy

### Quality Gates

Our security pipeline implements strict quality gates:
- **Zero Critical Vulnerabilities**: No critical security issues are allowed in production
- **Limited High Severity Issues**: Maximum of 5 high severity issues allowed
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Daily security scans via scheduled workflows

## 🔐 Secure Usage Guidelines

### API Key Management

```python
# ✅ RECOMMENDED: Use environment variables
import os
from src.main import create_app

# Load API keys from environment
config = {
    "llm": {
        "api_key": os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),  # Never hardcode
        "base_url": "https://api.openai.com"
    }
}

# ❌ NEVER DO THIS: Hardcoded secrets
config = {
    "llm": {
        "api_key": "sk-1234567890abcdef",  # Security violation!
        "base_url": "https://api.openai.com"
    }
}
```

### Configuration Security

```yaml
# ✅ RECOMMENDED: Environment variable substitution
llm:
  api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
  base_url: "https://api.openai.com"

# ❌ AVOID: Hardcoded credentials in config files
llm:
  api_key: "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # Never commit secrets!
```

### Network Security

- **TLS/HTTPS**: All external communications use HTTPS
- **API Key Injection**: API keys are injected into headers, never exposed in URLs
- **Header Filtering**: Sensitive headers are filtered from logs and traces

### Data Handling

- **Request/Response Filtering**: Sensitive data can be excluded from traces
- **Session Isolation**: Each session is isolated with unique identifiers
- **Memory Management**: Sensitive data is not cached indefinitely

## 🏢 Enterprise Security Features

### Security Standards

We implement security best practices including:
- **Secure development lifecycle** with automated security testing
- **Vulnerability management** with continuous scanning and monitoring
- **Supply chain security** with dependency tracking and SBOM generation
- **Credential protection** with secret detection and secure handling practices

### Security Controls

| Control Category | Implementation | Status |
|------------------|---------------|---------|
| Vulnerability Prevention | Automated scanning, dependency monitoring | ✅ Implemented |
| Secure Development | SAST, secret detection, code review | ✅ Implemented |
| Container Security | Image scanning, minimal base images | ✅ Implemented |
| Supply Chain Security | SBOM generation, dependency tracking | ✅ Implemented |
| Data Protection | Secure credential handling, TLS encryption | ✅ Implemented |
| License Compliance | Automated license scanning and validation | ✅ Implemented |

### Vulnerability Prevention

- **Pre-Deployment Scanning**: Every release is scanned for known vulnerabilities before distribution
- **Dependency Security**: All third-party dependencies are continuously monitored for security issues
- **Source Code Analysis**: Static analysis tools prevent common security vulnerabilities in our code
- **Supply Chain Security**: Complete Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) tracks all components for transparency

## 🚨 Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Process

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@cylestio.com`
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if any)
3. **Response Time**: We commit to responding within 48 hours
4. **Resolution**: Critical issues resolved within 7 days, others within 30 days

### What to Report

Please report any of the following:
- Authentication bypasses
- Data exposure vulnerabilities
- Injection attacks (SQL, Command, etc.)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Information disclosure
- Privilege escalation

### What NOT to Report

The following are generally not considered vulnerabilities:
- Version disclosure
- Missing security headers (unless exploitable)
- Theoretical attacks without proof of concept
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks

## 🔄 Security Updates

### Update Schedule

- **Critical**: Emergency patches released immediately
- **High**: Patches released within 7 days
- **Medium**: Patches released in next minor version
- **Low**: Patches released in next major version

### Communication

Security updates are communicated via:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Email notifications (for enterprise customers)

## 📊 Security Metrics

Our automated security pipeline provides:
- **Vulnerability Scan Results**: Available in GitHub Actions artifacts after each run
- **Security Report Generation**: Automated reports for dependency, secret, and code analysis
- **Quality Gate Status**: Pass/fail status for security thresholds
- **SBOM Generation**: Weekly software bill of materials for transparency
